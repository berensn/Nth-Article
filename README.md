# Nth-Article
A Joomla module that allows for the placement of an article anywhere on the page. The module will always show the 1st, 2nd, ...Nth article, from the recent article list, sorted in descending order.

|-------------------------|
|1st (most recent article)|
|-------------------------|

|- Other Content -|

|-------------------------|
|2nd (next recent article)|
|-------------------------|

|- Other Content -|

|-------------------------|
|Nth (Nth recent article) |
|-------------------------|

The article positions stay the same but the articles are dynamic, if the module is set to show the 2nd article, it will always show the 2nd most recent article.
